# EarnX Protocol - Break the $40B Finance Gap

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform connecting African exporters with global DeFi capital using Chainlink infrastructure.

## 🎯 Mission Statement

**Breaking the $40B African trade finance gap** by connecting exporters who need immediate capital with global investors seeking real-world yields through verified invoice tokenization.

## 🌍 The Problem We Solve

- **African exporters** can't access working capital (wait 30-90 days for payment)
- **Global DeFi investors** can't find sustainable, real-world backed yields
- **Traditional trade finance** is slow (2-4 weeks), expensive (8-12% fees), and exclusive

## 💡 Our Solution

EarnX bridges both sides of this problem by creating a verified marketplace where:
- **Exporters** get instant liquidity by tokenizing verified invoices
- **Investors** earn sustainable yields (8-15% APR) backed by real African trade
- **Everyone benefits** from transparent, automated, Chainlink-verified processes

## 🌐 Live Demo & Experience
